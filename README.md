This script creates, enables, and runs a systemd service called remove-kvm.service.
The purpose of the service is to remove KVM kernel modules (kvm_intel and kvm) at system startup to prevent them from loading automatically.

What it does:

Creates the systemd service file at /etc/systemd/system/remove-kvm.service.

Configures the service to run once at boot (Type=oneshot).

Uses rmmod to remove kvm_intel and kvm modules (ignores errors if theyâ€™re not loaded).

Reloads systemd to apply changes.

Enables the service so it runs automatically at every boot.

Starts the service immediately without requiring a reboot.
